CoD4 Cameara Tool allows to dump camera information from the game on runtime, which can be imported to other 3D Software (Blender, UnrealEngine, Maya)

This repository designed to be used with [C2M](https://github.com/sheilan102/C2M/tree/master) so camera dump and map can be merged.

### This Alpha Release Includes:

- Support for CoD4x 21.1 for now
- Simple ingame indicator
- CSV format for export
- Python script for importing csv in to Blender
- Directx 9 Hook
